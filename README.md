# Hospital-Efficiency-Improvement
This project focused on reducing patient wait times, eliminating double bookings, and improving satisfaction across departments at HealthFirst Care. I applied business analysis frameworks (BRD, RTM, stakeholder mapping, process mapping) and data visualization techniques.

## Business Objectives
- Reduce patient wait times by 20% within 12 months  
- Eliminate double bookings  
- Improve patient satisfaction and communication  
- Optimize resource utilization  

## My Contributions
- Conducted requirements gathering (BRD, RTM)  
- Led stakeholder analysis and engagement planning  
- Designed BPMN workflows and swimlane diagrams  
- Built dashboards for patient feedback and resource utilization  
- Proposed risk mitigation strategies  

## Tools Used
- Excel (pivot tables, charts)  
- Lucidchart / Draw.io (BPMN, Swimlane diagrams)  
- PowerPoint (presentation and visualization)  

## Key Outcomes
- Identified peak congestion periods (11AM–1PM, 3–6PM)  
- Recommended automation of scheduling and self-check-in kiosks  
- Proposed staff reallocation and training for adoption  
- Designed risk mitigation strategies for scheduling conflicts and data security
