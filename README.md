**Goal:** Reduce patient wait times and eliminate double-booking errors at HealthFirst Care.
**Role:** Business Analyst
**Tools:** Excel (Pivot Tables), Lucidchart (BPMN), Risk Management Frameworks.

## 📊 Project Overview
HealthFirst Care faced operational bottlenecks leading to long wait times and patient dissatisfaction. This project utilized data analysis and process mapping to identify root causes and propose a digital transformation strategy.

## 🔍 Key Findings (Data Analysis)
Using Excel Pivot Tables to analyze appointment datasets, I uncovered the following:
* **Peak Congestion:** The highest volume of patients occurs between **11:00 AM – 1:00 PM** and **3:00 PM – 6:00 PM**.
* **Departmental Stress:** Cardiology and Pediatrics showed the highest demand and longest wait times.
* **Satisfaction Gap:** While 86.4% of feedback was positive, Oncology and General Medicine showed specific clusters of low satisfaction.

## 🔄 Process Improvement (BPMN)
I mapped the **"As-Is"** manual workflows against a proposed **"To-Be"** automated system:
* **Identified Bottleneck:** Manual appointment booking required admin confirmation, causing delays and errors.
* **Proposed Solution:** AI-driven scheduling with real-time conflict alerts and self-check-in kiosks.
* **Projected Impact:** Targeted a **20% reduction** in average patient wait times within 12 months.

## ⚠️ Risk Management
Developed a Risk Register to mitigate deployment threats:
* **High Risk:** Double bookings during peak hours.
* **Mitigation:** Implemented automated conflict detection and "Must Have" requirements for real-time SMS/Email updates.
